<p>I'm a highschool student who learned coding through youtube videos, as i love the unlimited creativity programming offers you!</p>
<br />
<p>I spend most of my time learning new programming languages and sharpening my current coding skills. Outside of coding, I enjoy playing some Badmintonüè∏ and when i need some de-stress, i play games.</p>
